# Kanbine

_Kanban for Redmine_

### Integrations

Kanbine integrates with Redmine Backlogs and Redmine Grouped Tags to colour the issues on the kanban screen. If Backlogs is installed then the colour of the story theme is used. If the tags plugin is installed, then a preference appears in the settings to select the tag group to use for the colour. Tags will always take priority over backlogs. If neither are installed it will fall back to the default auto-generated colours.

### Requirements

+ Redmine >= 3
+ Ruby >= 1.9.3
+ Rails 4(.2)
